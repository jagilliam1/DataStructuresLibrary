This project contains 3 parts of a data structures library. Each phase has a main which gives test cases and their desired output. The first phase contains a circular dynamic array: AKA a vector. The second phase contains a Balanced Binary Tree
in the form of a Red Black Tree. The last phase contains a heap using my own CDA and a binomial heap
